Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

--- Four pages: 
1) hiking.html ( index page is the same - sorry for calling it differently) it has a taskbar where are Contact list to my social networks, and Places where you can hike which leads to three other pages. It has some grid models and media, when the window is smaller puts album elements from row to column. 

2) garezeri.html has some pictures and an unordered list of items of this place. 

3) amata.html has ordered list of the place

4) veczemju.html pictures table of distances and time.

--- stylesheet files:
hiking.css is first style sheet. Have many ID and Classes. @media min-width for pending.

hike.css is sass generated from hike.scss file (hike.css.map) has variable $background-color and color, nesting fonts and inheritance for background pictures.  
And (pic) folder for pictures 

--- description of project 
I took an example of a bootstrap album example, there are some buttons which lead to endomondo to hiking route. And you can click to "view button" or album picture to go to that page. 
The main idea is to show some pictures and routes for hiking places in Latvia.
